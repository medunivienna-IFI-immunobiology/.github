Moritz here, note that this document is not public as the repository is private :)

Regarding this GitHub Organization: I suggest we make one new repository per publication where the source code etc. is stored. In addition, we can update the organization's profile accordingly. The organizion's profile text is managed by the README file in the folder "profile" of this private repository. I suggest we make each entry follow the same pattern, like this:


Manuscript title
Authors
Manuscript status (e.g. published in xy, with DOI)


Of course, with appropriate markdown formatting (just copy-paste). And that's it!
